## Introduction

Algorithmic bias refers to the phenomenon where an algorithm produces unfair or discriminatory outcomes, typically against certain groups of people based on their race, gender, age, religion, sexual orientation, or other characteristics. With the rise of artificial intelligence and new technologies with it, algorthmic bias is a problem that will continue to grow if it is continued to be left unoticed. The article "Dissecting Racial Bias in an Algorithm Used to Manage the Health of Populations" relased by Science examines how an algorithm used in healthcare can perpetuate racial bias. The article focuses on an algorithm that is used to identify patients who may benefit from additional healthcare services or lower costs. The author dives deep into one specific algorithm used in the industry, which he found in his study to exhibit racial bias. It presented racial bias by assigning a lower risk score to White patients over Black patients, even though they had similar similar scores throughout the different variables the algorithm would use to determine health risk score.

A description to the dataset and how it was obtained can be found under this link: https://gitlab.com/labsysmed/dissecting-bias

Some of the reasons as to why I chose this dataset to analyze include having a deeper understanding of algorithms that are racially biased, and determining if this algorithm in specific is racially biased. As a first generation student and person of color, taking a closer look at the data and how this algorithm works will help me understand how algorithms can be not only racially biased, but could lead inaccurate decisions and outcomes that may lead to people of color have inmense disavantages in several aspects of life, not only the health care system.

Therefore, with this data set, I will take a high level overview of analysis to explore how risk scores are being assigned to patients. Specifically, I will try to answer the question what factors could make this algorithm racially bias? How is it affecting patients of color?
