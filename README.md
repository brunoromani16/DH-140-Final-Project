# Consequences of Algorithmic Bias

## Introduction

In this project, I will be taking a closer look at the topic of **algorithmic bias**. In a world where artificial intelligence technology continues to grow exponentially with time, addressing the concern of algorithmic bias may be informational to several minority cultures. To begin with, algorithmic bias is defined to be errors or unfair choices made by machine learning algorithms. These biases arise due to a variety of reasons, some include incorrect choice of predictor variables and biased training data.

The [article](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aax2342) "Dissecting Racial Bias in an Algorithm Used to Manage the Health of Populations" released by *Science* examines how an algorithm used in healthcare can perpetuate racial bias. The article focuses on an algorithm that is used to identify patients who may benefit from additional healthcare services or lower costs. The author dives deep into one specific algorithm used in the industry, which he found in his study to exhibit racial bias. It presented racial bias by assigning a higher risk score to White patients over Black patients, even though they had similar scores throughout the different variables the algorithm would use to determine health risk score. A description of the dataset and how it was obtained can be found under this [link](https://gitlab.com/labsysmed/dissecting-bias). The model is trained on 160 different independent variables, with the risk score being the target variable.  

Some of the reasons as to why I chose this dataset to analyze include having a deeper understanding of algorithms that are racially biased, and determining if this algorithm in specific is racially biased. As a first generation student and person of color, taking a closer look at the data and how this algorithm works will help me understand how algorithms can be not only racially biased, but could lead inaccurate decisions and outcomes that may lead to people of color have immense disadvantages in several aspects of life, not only the health care system. 

Therefore, with this data set, I will take a high level overview of analysis to explore how risk scores are being assigned to patients. Specifically, I will try to answer the question: What factors could make this algorithm racially biased? How is it affecting patients of color? Does this have a long term effect on patients of color? 

I will try to answer this question beginning with an exploratory data analysis of the data set. After getting more insight into the data and determining which variables can be useful in predicting risk score for a patient, I will try to apply a machine learning model (linear regression) which will show me how well it performs with the variables selected and the weight of each variable on predicting the risk score of a patient. Also, they measure risk score through the total of medical expenses variable (cost_t). Therefore, the algorithm is trained with cost_t as the dependent or target variable.
